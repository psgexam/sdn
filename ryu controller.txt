Using pip3 command to install Ryu Controller is the easiest option. If pip3 already installed, skip
the first command

$ sudo apt install python-pip3
$ sudo pip3 install ryu

Test Ryu Controller with Simple Switch
First, open a terminal and run Mininet with the following command. This starts a network
emulation environment with 1 switch and 3 hosts.

$ sudo mn --topo single,3 --mac --controller remote --switch ovsk

Second, open another new terminal and run a simple switch controller. This controller will flood
a packet to all ports if the switching table has no record of the destination mac address and add a
record which specifies the source mac address at in port.

$ ryu-manager ryu.app.simple_switch
loading app ryu.app.simple_switch
loading app ryu.controller.ofp_handler
instantiating app ryu.app.simple_switch of SimpleSwitch
instantiating app ryu.controller.ofp_handler of OFPHandler

After opening the Ryu controller, test the reachability between these three hosts.
mininet> pingall

In the terminal of the Ryu controller, displays packet in messages.
After opening the Ryu controller, test the OpenFlow messages using Wireshark

mininet> h1 ping h2

Open Wireshark and filter openflow messages
